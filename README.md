# Airtable Blocks Sprint Planning

This is a web application using [Airtable's Blocks SDK](https://airtable.com/developers/apps).

This is used to bring Agile/ Scrum Tools to Airtable. It allows you to better plan sprints by showing an overview of allocated tasks and points across upcoming sprints grouped by person.

Additionally, the 'rebalancing' feature allows you to set a max complexity per-sprint and it will redistribute tasks across upcoming sprints for you.
